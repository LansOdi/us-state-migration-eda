## üìä Final Dashboard

This project culminates in a fully interactive Tableau dashboard that tells the story of American migration patterns. The dashboard allows users to explore net migration rates, efficiency, and the busiest migration corridors.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project answers the question: **Which U.S. states are the biggest magnets for new residents, and which are losing them the fastest?**

The analysis starts with a complex, raw crosstabulation matrix from the U.S. Census Bureau. The data is cleaned and reshaped using Python (Pandas) and then analyzed to uncover key insights.

### Key Findings:
* The "Sun Belt" phenomenon is confirmed, with states like **Florida, Texas, and the Carolinas** seeing the highest net migration gains.
* When normalized for population, smaller states like **North Dakota and Idaho** show some of the highest growth rates.
* The busiest single migration corridor in the nation is from **California to Texas**.
